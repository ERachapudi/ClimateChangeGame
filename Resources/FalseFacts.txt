THE EARTH’S CLIMATE HAS ALWAYS CHANGED: Over the course of the Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history, the climate has changed a lot.
PLANTS NEED CARBON DIOXIDE: Plants do need carbon dioxide (CO2) to live. Plants and forests remove and store away huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.
ANIMALS WILL ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide
Changes are due to sunspots/galactic cosmic rays. Sunspots are storms on the sun’s surface that come with intense magnetic activity and can be accompanied by solar flares. These sunspots do have the power to modify the climate on Earth.
